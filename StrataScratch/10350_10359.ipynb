We have a table with the user's search term, search result positions, and whether or not the user clicked on the search result. Write a query that assigns ratings to the searches in the following way: - If the search was not clicked for any term, assign the search with rating=1 - If the search was clicked but the top position of clicked terms was outside the top 3 positions, assign the search a rating=2 - If the search was clicked and the top position of a clicked term was in the top 3 positions, assign the search a rating=3 As a search ID can contain more than one search term, select the highest rating for that search ID. Output the search ID and its highest rating. Example: The search_id 1 was clicked (clicked = 1) and its position is outside of the top 3 positions (search_results_position = 5), therefore its rating is 2.```"
